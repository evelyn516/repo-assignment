## Project Description:
The aim of this 24 hour programming challenge was to create a GitHub repo tracker which makes use of React. There is a user input to type in a GitHub username, and after submitting, the GitHub API is used to to retrieve the users list of repos. When selecting a repo, you will be directed to the GitHub page for that repo.
